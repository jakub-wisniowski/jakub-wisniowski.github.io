        Each mini game is available in three difficulty levels and in five
        categories. In the first game - quiz, user has to select a correct
        english word describing the image. Depending on the difficulty level,
        options are displayed either as caption or as an audio recording. The
        second game - memory required the user to connect images with
        appropriate words. In the last game - baskets - user has to divide words
        into two categories by swiping left or right.

        This game was created as my thesis in a three-person group. We drew all
        the illustrations and recorded the audios in order to make the game more
        appealing to children. Mr Dumpling was written using C# and the Unity
        engine. It uses Player Preferences to store user's progress and score.
        Game has been integrated with Google Play Services, so that players can
        compete with their friends and gain achievements. Game is available in
        Google Play Store.
